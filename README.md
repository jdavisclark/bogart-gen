# bogart-gen

## About
  Bogart is an awesome framework, but it currently does not come with a CLI.  This module provides a CLI to help you get started quicker and easier with Bogart.

## Installation

```
npm install -g bogart-gen
```

## Usage

### Generate an app
  The easiest way to get started in Rails is now the easiest way to get started in Bogart.  Just use
  ```
  bogart new <appName>
  ```
  This will generate a folder tree that looks like this:

  appName
  |
  
  |__ lib
  
  |  |__ apis
  
  |  |__ repositories
  
  |  |__ views
  
  |  |  |__ layout.html
  
  |  |
  
  |  |__ routers
  
  |  |  |__ hello.js
  
  |  |  |__ middleware.js
  
  |  |  |__ static-content.js
  
  |  |
  
  |  |__ util.js
  
  |
  
  |__ public
  
  |  |__ images
  
  |  |__ javascripts
  
  |  |__ stylesheets
  
  |  
  
  |__ db
  
  |  |__ migrations
  
  |  |__ schema.sql
  
  |
  
  |__ config
  
  |  |__ settings.js
  
  |
  
  |__ Readme.md
  
  |__ app.js
  
  |__ package.json
  

### Generate a repository
  Repositories are the database abstraction layer of a Bogart application.  Currently, bogart-gen only supports MySQL.  Repos generated with bogart-gen will contain a basic CRUD with five functions:
  - ```javascript
  get:  // Get an object from the database by it's id
  ```
  - ```javascript
  set:  // Create a new entry in the DB, or update an existing one if the object passed to it has an ID
  ```
  - ```javascript
  search:  // More flexible than list, and return is compatible with GammaGrid
  ```
  - ```javascript
  del:  // Deletes an entry from the database 
  ```
From the CLI, use ```bogart generate repo <modelName>``` to generate a repo.

### Generate an API
  bogart-gen can create Bogart routing files for you so you can get up and running quickly.  All API routes generated by bogart-gen will start with '/api/'.  These API's will expose all of the repository methods; returns will be in JSON.
  Generate an API by calling the following from the command line:

```
bogart g api <modelName>
```
  You'll notice that this uses 'g' instead of 'generate'; this is a convenience provided by bogart-gen, it doesn't matter whether you use 'g' or 'generate'.

### Generate a router
  With ```bogart g router <name> [routes]```, you can generate a router file with a few predefined routes (unless you specify the ```--lite``` option).  For example, ```bogart g router post``` would generate the following file:
  
  ```javascript
    var bogart = require('bogart');

    module.exports = function (router, viewEngine) {
      router = router || bogart.router();

      router.get('/posts', function (req) {
        
      });

      router.get('/post/:id', function (req){

      });

      router.post('/post', function (req) {
        
      })
    }
  ```
  With ```bogart g router post --lite``` the output becomes

  ```javascript
  var bogart = require('bogart');

  module.exports = function (router, viewEngine) {
    router = router || bogart.router();

    //Specify routes here
    /*Example:
    router.get('/post/:id', function (req){

    });
    */
  }
  ```
